//Example Temperature

//These three could define same but are totally different:
var temperature;      //if the value for temperature is coming from  API which data is empty, it would be undefined.
// temperature = 0;     //defines a valid temperature
// temperature = null;      //defines null as value
console.log(temperature);

// As solution, conditions would work as shown below:
// Example Grade System
let myGrade = 7;
let gradeCheck = myGrade < 10;

console.log(gradeCheck);
